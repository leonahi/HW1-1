Serial:

The code uses the basic method for computing matrix products.

Memory are initialised using double pointers and random float values assigned to them.
Double pointers allows  to access elements using the standard X[i][j] notation.

OpenMP:

Code to compute product is same as for serial with the exception of having 
to use a #pragma. The pragma allows us to initialize multiple threads for use on
a multi-core machine. 

pragma code

MPI:

Based on the idea of master and slave(nodes) each having a unique id.
The master initializes the respective matrices and then based on stripsize respective parts of A are sent to each node
 while entire B matrices are sent to all nodes. Repective memory locations sent using MPI_Send.  Multiplication routines as per serial. 
The completed products are then reassembled in the Master node to get the complete product using MPI_Recv.


Bash Scirpt:
The bash script 
1. Gathers system information
2. Automates passing of arguement's ie matrix size and threads. 
3. Output's are registered into a file and the plots are done using gnuplot.
